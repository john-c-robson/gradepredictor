## Introduction

The Grade Tracker and Predictive Grading App is an Android application developed in Android Studio. It allows users to track their grades for different assignments, and it can also predict their grade for the next assignment using a custom API built with PythonAnywhere, which provides a linear regression output based on previous grades. This app is designed to help students better plan their academic performance and set goals for their future assignments.

## Features

- **Grade Tracking**: Users can input and save their grades for various assignments, courses, or subjects.

- **Predictive Grading**: The app can predict a user's grade for the next assignment using a custom PythonAnywhere API that employs linear regression based on historical grade data.

- **User-friendly Interface**: The app offers an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for tracking grades and accessing predictive grades.

- **Data Visualization**: Users can view their grade history through interactive charts and graphs.
